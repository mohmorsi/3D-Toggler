# 3D Toggler

</div>

## Introduction
This interface includes a checkbox input and a label that consists of four layers, each of which is styled differently to create a 3D effect. When the checkbox is clicked, the layers are transformed to create a visual toggle between two states.

## HTML Code

The head section includes meta tags, the title of the document, and a link to an external stylesheet. The body section includes an input element with a checkbox type and an id of "toggle". The label element has a "for" attribute that matches the id of the checkbox input. The label also includes four div elements, each with a class of "layer". These div elements are used to create the 3D effect of the toggle button.

## CSS Code

CSS code contains styles for an animated toggle switch. The toggle switch consists of several layers, including a base, a stalk, and a face, as well as a background. The code defines various animations for these layers, including rotations and translations.

The code begins with setting a relative position for all elements and increasing the zoom of the HTML element to 1.25. The height of both the HTML and body elements is set to 100%. The body element is set to display flex, with no margin and a font size of 4em. The background color is defined using a linear gradient.

The wrap class is defined to have a width of 4em, a height of 1em, and is centered using margin: auto. The toggle element is hidden.

The face layer has a width and height of 2em, a border-radius of 1em, and a linear gradient background. The transform property is used to rotate the face by 45 degrees and translate it in the z-axis by 0.5em.
